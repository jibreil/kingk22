    <h2 id="step-1-setup-qmk">Step 1: setup QMK</h2>
    <p>Follow the instructions in the <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started">QMK docs</a> to setup your QMK environment, by the end of this step you should have all the dependencies installed and a folder with all the QMK stuff.</p>
    <h2 id="step-2-createedit-a-layout">Step 2: create/edit a layout</h2>
    <p>QMK layouts are found in <code>keyboards/&lt;keyboard&gt;/keymaps/&lt;keymap_name&gt;/</code>. For example, the default layout for the TADA68 is <code>keyboards/tada68/keymaps/default/</code>.</p>
    <p>To make your own layout, copy the <code>default</code> folder and rename it to something else, <code>clack</code> for example which would give us <code>keyboards/tada68/keymaps/clack/</code> which will have 3 files in it:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li><code>keymap.c</code></li>
        <li><code>readme.md</code></li>
        <li><code>rules.mk</code></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Out of those 3, the <code>readme.md</code> file is not required but is present by default, the <code>rules.mk</code> file contains advanced build options for QMK and for most users can be left alone. The <code>keymap.c</code> file is where the magic happens and in here you can edit the default layout to your own liking. Thorough instructions for editing this can also be found in the <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware">QMK docs.</a></p>
    <h2 id="step-3-build-the-firmware">Step 3: build the firmware</h2>
    <p>The TADA68 is unique to most other mechanical keyboards in terms of putting your own layout on it as you drop a <code>.bin</code> file on the keyboard as if it was a regular mass storage device rather than flashing a <code>.hex</code> file to the controller.</p>
    <p>To generate the <code>.bin</code> file, just run the following command within the QMK root directory:</p>
    <p><code>make tada68:&lt;name&gt;:flashbin</code></p>
    <p>Where <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the name of the directory you created in step 2, following from our example where the name of the foler was <code>clack</code> you would run <code>make tada68:clack:flashbin</code>.</p>
    <p>If there is an issue with your layout you’ll get an error after the make command. If there are no errors, you’ll find a shiny new <code>.bin</code> file in the QMK root directory, following our example again we’ll find <code>tada68_clack.bin</code> in the root directory. This is the file you’ll need to put onto your board.</p>
    <h2 id="step-4-loading-your-layout-onto-your-keyboard">Step 4: loading your layout onto your keyboard</h2>
    <p>To get your layout onto your keyboard, plug it in and press the reset switch, it should show up as a removable device and you’ll find a <code>.bin</code> file already on it with the default layout, the board only has enough storage for one layout os backup this file somewhere on your computer and replave it with the <code>.bin</code> file created in step 3.</p>
    <p>When the new layout file is on the board, press escape to get the board out of the bootloader mode and it <strong><em>should</em></strong> be working on the new layout.</p>
