### 1. Which lines from one of Auden's poems do you find the most inspiring? Why?

The majority of poems written by Auden present a grim past and a bleak future but **September 1, 1939** - whilst touching on a dark past - tries to give a way forward into a positive future, one with no suffering or pain through the means of avoiding war. The most inspiring line in this poem - and arguably in all of Auden's poetry - is the final line of the 8th stanza (which later became the final stanza and line of the poem):

**"We must love one another or die"**

This line is inspiring for 2 reasons; firstly, it urges the audience to go beyond their own prejudices, disregard their apathy and ignorance and to take responsibility both individually and collectively to enact political change for the better. Secondly, it shows the shift in Auden's perspective on people and politics as he later included a note with this poem that it was **"trash he was ashamed to have written."** He also famously turned against this line after it was published, omitting the last stanza of the poem and altering this line to **"We must love one another and die,"** changing the meaning from suggesting that love can somehow save us from war and death to presenting an existential statement where life is ultimately tragedy.

The idealistic to nihilistic shift also seems to express that Auden, in hindsight, thought that perhaps in the case of WWII, war in the name of love was justified.

### 2. What has been the most provocative aspect of studying these poems?

Auden has a habit of presenting either a grim past, a bleak future or both in his poetry and while on the surface this seems like a depressing and monotonous commonality but hidden within his poems are deep discussions on core human values and the inner workings of society which often present ideas to guide the human race onto a positive path which, when studied, present provocative aspects to the audience. In **September 1, 1939,** Auden presents one such provocative idea with **"We must love one another or die"** In this quote, Auden is showing how interconnected society is and how interdependent people are and because of this, people must go beyond their own prejudices, disregard their apathy and ignorance and take responsibility both individually and collectively to enact political change for the better.

It also shows the shift in Auden's perspective on people and politics as he later included a note with this poem that it was “trash he was ashamed to have written.” He also famously turned against this line after it was published, omitting the last stanza of the poem and altering this line to “We must love one another and die,” changing the meaning from suggesting that love can somehow save us from war and death to presenting an existential statement where life is ultimately tragedy.

The idealistic to nihilistic shift also seems to express that Auden, in hindsight, thought that perhaps in the case of WWII, war in the name of love was justified.

### 3. When you first encountered these poems what did you think? What do you think now?

On first reading them, Auden's poems present a grim past, a bleak future or both which gives the initial impression that they're all cynical, depressing and monotonous but, upon further study, it is revealed that this isn't always the case. 

For example, in Auden's **"September 1, 1939,"** he writes **"We must love one another or die,"** at first this seems almost meaningless or childish, but as you dwell on its meaning, it occurs that Auden is urging the audience to go beyond their own prejudices, to disregard their apathy and ignorance and to take responsibility both individually and collectively to enact political change for the better. This line also shows a shift in Auden's perspective on people and politics as he later included a note with this poem that it was **“trash he was ashamed to have written.”** He also famously turned against this line after it was published, omitting the last stanza of the poem and altering this line to **“We must love one another and die,”** changing the meaning from suggesting that love can somehow save us from war and death to presenting an existential statement where life is ultimately tragedy.

The idealistic to nihilistic shift also seems to express that Auden, in hindsight, thought that perhaps in the case of WWII, war in the name of love was justified.

All of this has led me to change my perspective and understanding of Auden's poetry, from seeing nothing more than a cynics brain dump to a complex and meaningful commentary on humanity and society.

### 1. What aspect of the structure of ONE poem did you find most interesting? Why?

Auden's **O What is that Sound** differs from the usual non-rhythmical structure of Auden's poetry and takes the form of a ballad. It's rhyming nature contributes to its popularity and would've evoked strong emotions in the audience of its time due to its relateable descriptions of the private terrors felt in those ages of political control and persecution, invoking an atmosphere of war or impending war such as the persecution of intellectuals by the Bolsheviks or of certain minorities by the Nazis. But the most interesting part of the structure of **O What is that Sound** is that, as Auden said in a later lecture, his intent was to compose a poem that produced a nightmarish effect yet the second, presumably male voice, in the poem is placating, soothing and reassuring. Their explanations seem euphemistic and benign, deflecting this apparent threat of war and giving hope to the first voice who urgently fears for the safety of them both.

### 2. What do you think is the most thought provoking use of language? Why?

### 3. Identify and explain ONE main idea that these poems are conveying.

Taking a look at Auden's poetry as a whole, two main aspects are apparent, a grim and bleak perspective of the world but underneath that, Auden has placed words of hope and instruction, intended to guide society away from war, destruction and death and to move towards a positive future of political and personal freedom. This is shown in **O What is that Sound** with the first voice desperately asking questions out of urgent fear, invoking an atmosphere of war or impending war such as the persecution of intellectuals by the Bolsheviks or of certain minorities by the Nazis. But the second, presumably male voice, in the poem is placating, soothing and reassuring. Their explanations seem euphemistic and benign, deflecting this apparent threat of war and giving hope to the first voice who urgently fears for the safety of them both.

### 1. What was the most interesting thing you learnt about the context of the poems? In what way/s did this enhance your understanding of the poems?

The context of Auden's poetry is evidenced in the poems themselves which are concerned with and convey strong political, social and psychological contexts. While the communist teaching of figured such as Karl Marx played a hand in Auden's early works, it then gave way to some religious and spiritual influences later on in his writing.

Auden is sometimes labelled as **"antiromantic,"** a poet who writes in a very analytical manner, seeking order and patterns but I think Auden is the exact opposite of this, as shown in his later works which are versatile and inventive in length, structure and content, incorporating Auden's own feelings, his observations and even some scientific knowledge.

Another big contributing factor to the context of Auden's poetry is his childhood in a heavily industrialised area in England with parents who had extensive knowledge in mythology and folklore and were strict Anglicans and these influences are seen frequently in Auden's poetry. His later works evidence his travels with poems such as **Spain** describing his experience in the country during its late 1930s civil war.

Understanding these contexts, both on Auden himself and on his poetry, allow for a greater understanding of the poetry as it gives an insight into the mind behind them and assists in explaining the background behind some of the poems.

### 2. How has the representation of people and politics led you to a greater awareness of the complexity of human behaviour?

The representation of people and politics refers to the perspective one takes of events and personalities and how they can be represented in different ways with different meanings in various forms and language. Understanding this concept allows the audience to grasp a greater awareness and understanding of human nature and behaviour. In Auden's poetry, he reflects his cautionary view of governments or people in power that oppress their own citizens. His famous poem, **Spain,** was written after Auden had observed, first hand, the immediate effects of the Spanish civil war and outlines that politically conscious individuals have the capacity to ‘rebel’ against structured political ideologies and enact political change for the better.

### 3. How has your study of Auden's work supported the idea that 'all representations are acts of manipulation'?

Representations are subjective constructions that convey a version of reality and an understanding of how composers can manoeuvre and manipulate the views of the audience and responders to influence the political environment, usually through the portrayal of characters or events in a certain way that corresponds to the aim and views of the author. In Auden's poetry, he reflects his cautionary view of governments or people in power that oppress their own citizens. His famous poem, **Spain,** was written after Auden had observed, first hand, the immediate effects of the Spanish civil war and outlines that politically conscious individuals have the capacity to 'rebel' against structured political ideologies and enact political change for the better.

Whilst this seems to be a positive outcome, it still supports the idea that 'all representations are acts of manipulation' and paves the way for discussion and debate on whether this is the place of authors such as Auden to try and influence the political environment through their texts.
